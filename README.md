Nux
===

Asynchronous mvc module inheritance framework for complex object design.

## Whut?

Writing javascript is fun! re-writing it is boring. Using frameworks is awesome, but hooking them up can be tedious.
In any modern javascript application you tend to do:
  
+ asyncronous loading
+ framework loading
+ big objects
+ interface stuff
+ server loady stuff

I also want:

+ clean namespace
+ easy testing
+ object inheritence
+ DRY logic

I also have a shed load of files I personally love:

+ chosen.js, gridster, sockey.io .. jquery plugins ..

Current tools tend to be:

require, jquery, jasminejs, backbone, ember, .. list is forever ..

To build a modern application using javascript, you need to write a large amount code. 
As a modern developer, I'm hastly inviting OOP and DRY logic to everything I touch. 

By leveraging some excellent tools, Nux provides a light slimline extension, for you to create
large or complex javscript objects with worrying about the foreplay.

+ easy OOP style logic loading for framework level and application level object extension
+ simple and powerful method overrides for prototypal inheritance
+ easy asset loading for your other frameworks
+ natively asynscronous 
+ A single namespace

### Batteries included

Nux wouldn't be complete without some features to make it work. Lcukily these features are loaded into Nux
in the same way the extensions are made.

+ signals - integrated web socket events
