# notes

A nux extension is designed to be a single object existing in a larger scope. By creating a nux object (using the Nux library) an object can be scoped for inherited, extendable objects. 

# Imports

An extension can import other required extensions before or after the extension boots.

	A requires B and C
	B + C load then A

# Assets

An extension can load external assets before or after the extension has loaded. These assets can be JS CSS or other data files of which are not extensions.

# main

An extension can have a main method of which boots after assets and required extensions are imported.
